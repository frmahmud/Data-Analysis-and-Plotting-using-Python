**Data-Driven Analysis of GDP Growth across Countries and Regions**

This project utilizes Python to analyze historical Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for various countries and regions. It leverages Seaborn for data visualization, enabling insightful comparisons of economic trends.

**Key Steps:**
1. Data Acquisition: Both GDP and population data are loaded from CSV files.
2. Data Preprocessing: Country names are standardized using Python functions. Irrelevant columns are removed to streamline the analysis.
3. Feature Engineering: GDP per capita is calculated for each year between 1960 and 2020, enriching the data for deeper insights.
4. Comparative Analysis and Visualization: GDP growth trends across different world regions are compared and visualized using Seaborn's informative plots.
